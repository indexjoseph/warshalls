# Warshalls Honors Contract

# Date: 12/3/2023

# Authors: Charles Barth and Joseph Oladeji

# Description:
In this project we were tasked with implementing Warshalls 
Algorithm. This algorithm uses a register and each bit to store the values of 
the adjacency matrix. The algorithm is used to find the transitive closure of 
a graph. This program will display the before and after of the transitive 
closure of the graph.

# Usage: 

```bash
spim -f warshalls.asm | python3 display.py  
```

# Requirements

GraphViz - https://graphviz.org/

# How to download?

pip (or pip3) install graphviz
